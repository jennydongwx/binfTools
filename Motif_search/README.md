Problem: 
Given a collection of DNA strings **dna**, find a pattern and a collection of **k**-mers (one from each string) that minimizes the
distance between all possible patterns and all possible collections of k-mers.

Solution:
- Greedy Search with pseudocounts

- Randomized search with gibbs sampler

Sample input file contains **k**, **dna** (seperated by new line).
